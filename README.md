## My process

1.Reviewed all of the requirements needed in order to start the challenge (Blog preview card), This includes preparing assets needed.
2.Prepare file structure for easier navigation during development process.
3.Used Sass to make the styling more convinient.
4.Started to build the website from the Desktop screen to mobile screen


### Built with

- HTML5
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Desktop First Workflow


### What I learned

Learned proper Sass file structure. This helps me to organize all the things that I need starting from the resets, typography and mixins.

Tips that I learned from the net:
 - We must reduce Mixins usage as it affects the system performance.
 - Use specific naming in SASS variable, !Don't be too vague!
 - When doing a mobile first workflow use media min-width
 - When doing a desktop first workflow use media max-width
